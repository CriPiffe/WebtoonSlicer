# WebtoonSlicer
Slice your webtoon without interrupt the panels ;(

## How it works
Depending on the selected settings and method of work (brutal or optimal) it slice the chapter selected in many pages without interrupt the panels. It's very fast less than 10 seconds on chapter of 140.000x700 pixel size.

# TODO
- Improve graphical interface (it's my first time).
- Improve the optimal slice (yeah, now works fine, but it could be very better with not so much effort).
- Improve the setting parameters adding most significant ones and deleting the useless (maybe adding an 'advanced setting' voice somewhere)
- Improve the log interface and add an exernal detailed logfile.
- Understand how pyinstaller works and add the icon, also icon improvement would be appreciated
